Backing Up And Restoring A WattDepot PostgreSQL Database
========================================================

1. Create Backup
----------------

This section describes how to use the script to make manual backups.

1. On your server, log in as, or switch to, the "wattdepot" user.
2. Export the password for the PostgreSQL "wattdepot" user as the PGPASSWORD 
   environment variable: 
   
      % export PGPASSWORD="YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE"
      
3. Check that the /wattdepot-backups directory exists and is owned by user wattdepot: 

      % ls -al / | grep wattdepot-backups
      drwxr-xr-x.   2 wattdepot wattdepot  4096 Aug 30 14:34 wattdepot-backups
      
    3a. If wattdepot-backups does not exist, create it and take ownership of it: 
    
          % sudo mkdir /wattdepot-backups
          % chown wattdepot:wattdepot /wattdepot-backups 
          
2. In the wattdepot user's home directory, run the script wattdepot_backup_script.sh.

      % sh wattdepot_backup_script.sh

3. Look for the resulting backup file in /wattdepot-backups.
4. Unset the PGPASSWORD environment variable:

      $ unset PGPASSWORD

The wattdepot_backup_script.sh script creates a timestamped .tar.gz backup that 
contains the following:
- A plain text dump of the wattdepot database: plaintext_backup.dump
- The /home/wattdepot/.wattdepot directory
- The /home/wattdepot/wattdepot-2.2.1 directory

2. Restore Backup
-----------------

Prerequisites:
- The machine you are restoring the backup to must have:
  - Java 1.6 or newer
  - PostgreSQL (9.1 preferred)

1. Log onto the machine that will have the WattDepot backup loaded into it.
2. If a user named "wattdepot" does not exist, create a user "wattdepot" 
   with the same password as the "wattdepot" user on Mopsa.
3. Switch to the "wattdepot" user.
4. Switch to the "wattdepot" user's home directory.

      % cd ~/home/wattdepot

5. Copy the backup file wattdepot_backup_<timestamp>.tar.gz onto the host machine, 
   or onto a drive that is accessible to the host machine.
6. Extract the backup file and switch into it:

      % tar xzvf wattdepot_backup_<timestamp>.tar.gz
      % cd wattdepot_backup_<timestamp>

7. Copy the ".wattdepot" and "wattdepot-2.2.1" directories into /home/wattdepot:

      % cp -R ./.wattdepot /home/wattdepot/.wattdepot/
      % cp -R ./wattdepot-2.2.1 /home/wattdepot/wattdepot-2.2.1/

8. Change ownership of the ".wattdepot" and "wattdepot-2.2.1" directories to the "wattdepot" user:

      % chown -R wattdepot:wattdepot /home/wattdepot/.wattdepot/
      % chown -R wattdepot:wattdepot /home/wattdepot/wattdepot-2.2.1/

9. In Postgresql, create the "wattdepot" user and "wattdepot" database if they do not exist.
   Replace '<WATTDEPOT-POSTGRES-USER-PASSWORD>' with the password used for the "wattdepot" 
   user on Mopsa.

      % psql -U postgres
      postgres=# CREATE USER wattdepot WITH PASSWORD '<WATTDEPOT-POSTGRES-USER-PASSWORD>';
      CREATE ROLE
      postgres=# CREATE DATABASE wattdepot WITH OWNER wattdepot;
      CREATE DATABASE
      postgres=# ALTER USER wattdepot WITH SUPERUSER;

10. Exit Postgres.

      % postgres=# \q

11. Load the plaintext_backup.dump file into the ""wattdepot" database: 

      % psql -U wattdepot --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on wattdepot < plaintext_backup.dump

3. Verify
---------

The Wattdepot server must be started as the "wattdepot" user.

1. Switch to the wattdepot user's home directory:

      % cd /home/wattdepot

2. Start the server:

      % /usr/bin/java -cp /home/wattdepot/wattdepot-2.2.1/wattdepot-2.2.1.jar org.wattdepot.server.Server -d server-uh

3. Open a web browser. (Firefox is recommended. Internet Explorer may not work.)
   - Javascript must be enabled.
   - The Flash Player plugin must be installed and enabled.
4. Assuming the web browser is on the local machine, go to http://localhost:8190/wattdepot/SPA/index.html.
   Note:
   If the local machine is headless (no GUI), wget cannot be used to get data from the WattDepot SPA page.
   The SPA page must be accessed from a graphical web browser.

5. On the SPA page, select a source, a data type, and a date range that falls 
   within the time period before the backup was taken. Click "Visualize."
6. In another tab or another instance of the browser, go to 
   http://mopsa.hawaii.edu:8190/wattdepot/SPA/index.html. 
   Select the same source, data type, and date range as you did in the 
   previous step. Click "Visualize."
7. The information displayed from both servers should be the same.
   When finished, press Control+C to stop the WattDepot server.
